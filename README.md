Problem Statement :     According to the United Nations Development Programm  about 40% of the food produced in India is wasted. Even though the food produced in India is adequate, the UN hasreported that about 190 million of the Indian populationremain undernourished. These are some bleak statistics,but they should help us realize the magnitude of the problem of food waste, as much as inequity, in India. It hasbeen recognized that no truly sustainable and developedcountry can exist without tackling the issue of food wasteand some steps need to be taken sooner. 

Solution : The solution is the “Food waste reduction web application”.It enables restaurants and various non-profit organizationsto interact with each other. The web application comprisesof two logins:
1] restaurant login
2] uNGO login
This allows users and restaurants to interact with theapplication easily. The users can find the restaurants nearby while restaurants will be able to donat leftover
food. Thisfood can then reach out to the people in need. The restaurants and users can interact with the application by signing up. On signing,users’authentication is checkedand confirmed.NGO's will be able to contact these restaurants and then collect the food from them. This food which was once getting wasted now with the help of NGOs will reach out to people in need. The interface of the website has been designed in such a way to help the people navigate through easily. The web app also helps in bringing attention to the wastage of food.
